There are two major kinds of data which can be classified according to the source:
1. Public data
2. Private data
A large amount of data collected by the government or other public agencies is made public for the purposes of research. Such data sets do not require special permission for access and are therefore called public data.
 
On the other hand, private data is that which is sensitive to organisations and is thus not available in the public domain. Banking, telecom, retail, and media are some of the key private sectors that rely heavily on data to make decisions.
