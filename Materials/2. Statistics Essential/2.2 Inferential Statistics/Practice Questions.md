Q: A fair coin is tossed 3 times. What is probability of one head, 2 tails?
A: 3/8 (HTT, TTH, THT)

A committee of three is chosen from five councilors - Adams, Burke, Cobb, Dilby and Evans.
What is the probability Burke is on the committee?
A: 6/10

Q: 
Expected Value
- But in the casino problem, for our red ball game, the expected value came out to be 2.385. What does that mean? How does that even help us with our original question, which was how much money, on average, are the players expected to make?
- Solution: Define X as the Money won after playing the game once
- Therefore: Expected X = P(4 red balls) * 150 + P(0,1,2,3) * -10 = 11.28
- The casino remains profitable if the EV of X is negative

- Now, the problem you saw earlier, where we were asked by a company to suggest whether it should invest in a given project or not.
The expected value of X, which is also called the expected return, is equal to
 
(-305)*P(X=-305) + (+15)*P(X=+15) + (+95)*P(X=+95) = (-305)*0.1 + (+15)*0.7 + (+95)*0.2 = -1 crore rupees.
 
So, the expected return of the project is -1 crore rupees. Hence, we can conclude that the project is not worth investing in.

Now, can you calculate the expected value of X (where X is the money won by the player after playing the game once)?
X (Money won after playing once)	Probability
+150	0.133
-10	0.867
 
You can use this probability distribution to find the answer.
A: 11.28

Q: How to make the above value negative/profitable?
    - Increase the penalty to 25
    - Decrease the prize money to 90
A: increase the penalty to 25


    - Q: 
    Generalised Probability
    What is the probability that you would get 4 red balls after 4 trials (One trial = taking out a ball, noting its colour, and putting it back in the bag), if the probability of getting a red ball in one trial is equal to p?
    - A: p4
    
    
Binomial Distribution:
Q: A student attempts a test with 10 multiple choice questions, where each question has 4 possible options. She does not know the correct answer to any of the questions and just randomly selects one of the 4 options for each of them. The probability that she would still get 3 questions correct is:

A: 10C3(1/4)3(3/4)7


Q:
Cumulative Probability
Letâ€™s define X as the number of wickets Ishant Sharma would take in the next T20 match he plays. Also, the following is an incomplete table for cumulative probability based on previous experience:
x(Number of wickets taken by Ishant Sharma in a T20 Match)	  F(x)  
0	0.35
1	0.55
2	0.75
 
What is the probability that he would take more than 2 wickets in the next  T20 match he plays?

A: 0.25
