### Disadvantages:
• Its not always clear from where we must start interpreting them, non-linear, lack of narrative 


### Facts & Dimensions:
• There are two types of data:
	- Facts
	- Dimensions
• Facts are numerical data, and dimensions are metadata. 
• Metadata explains the additional information associated with the factual variable. 
• Both facts and dimensions are equally important for generating actionable insights from a given data set.
