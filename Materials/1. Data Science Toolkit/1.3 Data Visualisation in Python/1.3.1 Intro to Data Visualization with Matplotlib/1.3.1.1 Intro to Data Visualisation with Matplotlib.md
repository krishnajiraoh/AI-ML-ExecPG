### Why visualize data?
- it is difficult for the human eye to decipher patterns from raw numbers only. 
- Sometimes, even the statistical information summarised from the data may mislead you to wrong conclusions. 
- Therefore, you should visualise the data often to understand how different features are behaving.

### Disadvantages:
- Its not always clear from where we must start interpreting them, non-linear, lack of narrative 


### Facts & Dimensions:
- There are two types of data:
	- Facts
	- Dimensions
- Facts are numerical data, and dimensions are metadata. 
- Metadata explains the additional information associated with the factual variable. 
- Both facts and dimensions are equally important for generating actionable insights from a given data set.
