## Matplotlib Charts II:

### Line:
- A line graph is used to present continuous time-dependent data. 
- It accurately depicts the trend of a variable over a specified time period
  ```
  plt.plot(x_axis, y_axis)
  plt.xticks(rotation=90)
  ```

- Note:
  - The plt.plot() function can be tweaked
  - plt.plot(y, 'ro') # ‘ro’ represents color (r) and marker (o)
    - Creates a scatter plot if we specify markers 
  - plt.plot(y, 'red', marker ='o')
    - a line plot with the points marked

### Histograms:
- Univariate 
- A histogram is a frequency chart that records the number of occurrences of an entry or an element in a data set. 
- It can be useful when you want to understand the distribution of a given series.
	```
	plt.hist(profit, bins =100,edgecolor='Orange',color='cyan')
	```

- Note:
	```
	out1, bins, out2 = plt.hist(profit, bins =100,edgecolor='Orange',color='cyan')
	plt.hist(list_1, bins =4, range=[40, 80], edgecolor ='white')
	```
		
### Box plots:
- Univariate 
- Box plots are quite effective in summarizing the spread of a large data set into a visual representation. 
- They use percentiles to divide the data range. 
	```
	plt.boxplot([ list_1, list_2])
	#Outputs 2 box plots
	```

- Box plots divide the data range into three important categories, which are as follows:
	- Median value: This is the value that divides the data range into two equal halves, i.e., the 50th percentile.
	- Interquartile range (IQR): These data points range between the 25th and 75th percentile values.
	- Outliers: These are data points that differ significantly from other observations and lie beyond the whiskers.
