### Joint plot:
- It plots the joint distribution between two variables along with each variableâ€™s marginal distribution (histogram)
- Ex: sns.jointplot(x,y)
  
    ```
    #Import this library
    importscipy.statsasstats

    #Change the code to the following
    sns.jointplot(inp1.Size, inp1.Rating, stat_func =stats.pearsonr )
    ```

### Reg plot (Regression):
- sns.jointplot(x,y, kind="reg")



### Pair plots:
- it shows joint and marginal distributions for all pairwise relationships and for each variable, respectively
- i.e., the pairplot creates a scatter-plot whereas in the case for the diagonal ones, where the same variable is being considered twice, a histogram is shown


- Application:
  - Pairplots instantly give you the relationship between one numeric variable with the rest of the numeric variables. This is pretty useful in identifying relationships between the target variable and the rest of the features.
		
		
### Box plot:
	```
  	sns.boxplot(x , y )
  	```

### Heat Map:
- Preferred for visualizing numeric values in a grid or a matrix
  ```
  sns.heatmap(data)
  ```

- Ex: White to dark green
    ``` 
    sns.heatmap(data, cmap="Greens", annot=True)
    ```
- Note: Heat maps are predominantly used in machine learning problems to visualise a  Correlation Matrix
