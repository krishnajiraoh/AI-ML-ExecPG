## Control Structures & Functions

### If-Elif_Else:
- Python supports statements like:
	○ if 90 <= score < 100
- Indentation : Four white spaces

### Loops:
- Repeat a certain operation 
- for I in range(1,10, 2) -> 2 is incrementor
- for n,a in enumerate(list) -> gives the index in n and the element in a
- for key,value in dict1.items() -> works similarly on a dict
	- d ={0: 'Fish',1: 'Bird',2: 'Mammal'}
	- for i in d:
		- print(i)
	- This prints only the keys "0 1 2"
	- By default, the iteration is over the keys.
- break, continue, pass
	- Pass does nothing & allows remaining code to be executed

### Comprehension:
- Increases readability of the code, more concise and elegant than explicit for loops, less verbose
- Improves efficiency of python code
- Allows parallelization, unlike loops

#### List
##### Example:
	paragraph = ["There was a fox." , 'It was brown in color.', "It was seen near that farm sometime back"]
	single_word_list  = [word for sentence in paragraph for word in sentence.split()]
	print(single_word_list)


	vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']
	vowels_comp = [word for sentence in paragraph for word in sentence.split() if word[0].lower() in vowels]
	print(vowels_comp)

	product_list = [ i*j for i in range(10) for j in range(10,20) ]
		

#### Dictionary:
- Iterations are on keys by default in dict
##### Example:

	students_data = {1:['Shivam Bansal', 24] , 2:['Udit Bansal',25], 3:['Sonam Gupta', 26], 
				4:['Saif Ansari',24], 5:['Huzefa Calcuttawala',27]}
				
	names_comp = {roll_num:details[0] for roll_num,details in students_data.items() if roll_num%2==0}
	
	print(names_comp)
	
	
### Functions:
- Functions perform a task or function.
- They are blocks of code that can be reused at various parts of the code as well as various files
- Recursive function 
	- Ex: factorial of a num
##### Ex: Accept flexible number of arguments
	Ex: def func(*args):
		 print(sum(args)
- Python internally handles args as tuple

### Lambda functions:
- Picked up by python from other functional programming languages
- Inline, temporary functions
- They aren't capable of multiple expressions and can only handle single expressions
##### Ex:
	product = lambda x,y : x*y
	print(product(x,y))
	print(type(product)) -> <class function>
	greater = lambda x,y : x if x > y else y
