## Practice Questions:

### 1. Find the output:

Input: </br>

ID,Department,Office,Rating </br>
U2F26,Finance,New Delhi,3.4 </br>
U2M61,Marketing,New Delhi,3.9 </br>
U1S15,Sales,New Delhi,2.8 </br>
U1H87,HR,Mumbai,2.1 </br>

Problem: </br>
In the dataframe created above, find the department that has the most efficient team (the team with minimum percentage of employees who need training).

Solution:
  ```
  df["Training"] = df["Rating"].apply(lambda x: True if x <= 3.5 else  False)
  df.groupby("Department")["Training"].sum()
  ```


Q: <to be checked>>
Given three data frames containing the number of gold, silver, and bronze Olympic medals won by some countries, determine the total number of medals won by each country. 
Note: All three data frames don’t have all the same countries. So, ensure you use the ‘fill_value’ argument (set it to zero), to avoid getting NaN values. Also, ensure you sort the final data frame, according to the total medal count in descending order. Make sure that the results are in integers.

A:

df.groupby(by="Country").mean().sort_values('Medals', ascending=False)[['Medals']]



### 3. Pivot table
Problem: </br>
Group the data 'df' by 'month' and 'day' and find the mean value for column 'rain' and 'wind' using the pivot table command.

Solution:
  ```
  df_1 = df.pivot_table(['rain','wind'],['month','day'],aggfunc={ 'rain': np.mean, 'wind': np.mean})
  ```

### 4. Qcut:
Q: for a table with columns Category=[X,y,Z]  size=10<s<30 and rating= 0<r<5, create a heatmap of rating vs Category vs size
A
Q_cut on size to conver to cat
Then pivot with category as index, size as columns, and rating as value
