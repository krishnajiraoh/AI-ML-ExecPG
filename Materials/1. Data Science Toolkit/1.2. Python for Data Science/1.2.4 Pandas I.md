## Pandas I

- Pandas is a library specifically for data analysis; it is built using NumPy. 
- Pandas has two main data structures:
  - Series
    - Different from list/NumPy array as it is associated with an index
  - DataFrames
- Like NumPy, it has its own data structure, called DataFrame
  - DataFrame is a table with rows and columns, with rows having an index each and columns having meaningful names

### Key features:
- DataFrame - Fast and efficient objects
- Loading data from different file formats
- Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data
- Reshaping and pivoting of datasets
- Label-based slicing, indexing and subsetting
- Mutable data structure
- Group-by functionality
- High-performance merging and joining of data
- Direct data plotting 
- Functionality to handle time series

### Basics:
- DataFrame can be created from dict, csv
- CSV: 
  - header=None

### Rows & Columns
- Rename the index Name
  ```
  df.index.name = "name"
  ```
- Delete the index Name
  ```
  df.index.name = None
  ```
- Hierarchical index
  ```
  df.set_index([col1,col2])
  ```

### Describing data:
- .info()
  - Info about the dataframe's dtypes, memory used, non-null values column wise
- .describe()
  - Get statistical info like min,max,mean, percentiles 

### Indexing & Slicing:
- dataframe.loc[[list_of_row_labels], [list_of_column_labels]]
- dataframe.iloc[rows, columns]
- Print even number rows:
  ```
  df.iloc[ 2::2 , :]
  ```
- Multiple conditions:
  ```
  [ (df['area'] > 0) & (df['wind']>1) & (df['temp']>15) ]
  ```
- .isin()
  ```
  sales[  (sales["Market"].isin(["LATAM", "Europe"])) & (sales["Sales"] > 250000)  ]
  ```
