## Numpy I:

- NumPy, an acronym for the term ‘Numerical Python’, is a library in Python which is used extensively for efficient mathematical computing. 
- This library allows users to store large amounts of data using less memory and perform extensive operations efficiently. 
- It provides optimized and simpler functionalities to perform aforementioned operations using homogenous, one-dimensional and multidimensional arrays
- a library meant for scientific calculations. 
- The basic data structure of NumPy is an array. 
- Ex: 
  - np_heights = np.array([10,20,30])
  - bmi = weights_kg / (heights_m ** 2)


### NumPy vs Lists:
- Lists must be iterated over or we must use List comprehensions for mathematical operations on all elements => Lack of multi-processing and hence lists are slower than NumPy
- Note: NumPy assumes the elements in the array are homogeneous, i.e., ints, floats, strings, etc
- + operator:
  - List : Concatenates the two lists and returns a list of size m + n
  - NumPy: Sums up the corresponding elements of two arrays and returns an array of size m
- Output/Print:
  - Elements in the NumPy array are separated by a space instead of a comma in Lists

### Conditional Sub-setting:
  #Count the number of elements with BMI < 21
  bmi[ bmi < 21 ].size
  sum(bmi < 21)
	
### Other functions:
	- .max(), .min(), .mean()

### Multi-dimensional arrays:
- .shape
- .ndim -> print the # dimensions
- .dtype
- .itemsize
- Perform Multiple operations at the same time
 #### Ex:
    # Matrix operations
    np.players * [num1 , num2]
  - This property of NumPy is called broadcasting
- Indexing
  - arr[ : , :]
- Conditional sub-setting:
  - arr[ arr[:0] > 1 ]

Creating NumPy arrays:
	- np.ones (5) -> array of 1s of size 5
	- np.ones(5, dtype=int)
		- Default dtype is float
	- np.ones((5,3)) -> nD array
	- np.zeros(5)
	- np.arange(3)
		- NumPy equivalent of range(3)
		- Default dtype is int
	- np.arange(3.0)
		- Creates with float as dtype 
	- np.arange(3,35,2)
	- np.random.randint(upper_bound, size=size)
		○ Ex: np.random.randint(5, size=10)
		○ Ex: np.random.randint(3,5, size=10)
	- np.random.random([3,4]) -> nD array, default boundary is 0,1
	- Array of length 10 between 1 and 10, step size is not known, to be calculated
		○ np.linspace(1,10,20)
		○ dtype is float by default
	- np.full(), np.tile(), np.eye()
